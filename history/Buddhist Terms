According to the older conceptions, the Buddha wrought many deeds of kindness and mercy in a long series of transmigrations as a Bodhisattva. The Jataka stories show that Bodhisattvas can be incarnated as men, or even as animals; but the more advanced Bodhisattvas, who have the greatest power for good, must be divine beings in the heavens. Bodhisattvas existing at present in the universe are working continuously for the welfare of all things living.
 
The universe of the Great Vehicle(Mahayana Buddhism) contains numerous Bodhisattvas, chief of whom, from the earthly point of view, is Avalokitesvara (“The Lord Who Looks Down”), also called Padmapani (“The Lotus-Bearer”). His special attribute is compassion, and his helping hand reaches even to Avici, the deepest and most unpleasant of the Buddhist purgatories. 

Another important Bodhisattva is Manjusri, whose special activity is to stimulate the understanding, and who is depicted with a naked sword in one hand, to destroy error and falsehood, and a book in the other, describing the ten paramitas, or great spiritual perfections, which are the cardinal virtues developed by Bodhisattvas. 

Vajrapani, a sterner Bodhisattva, is the foe of sin and evil, and like the god, Indra bears a thunderbolt in his hand. He assumes ferocious forms to combat demons and to guard the mystical teaching of Buddhism and is believed to be the protector of the nāgas. 
The gentle Maitreya, the future Buddha, yet to come to save the world is worshipped as a Bodhisattva. Maitreya will descend to earth to preach anew the dharma (“law”) when the teachings of Gautama Buddha have completely decayed. 

Ksitigarbha, the guardian of the purgatories, who is thought of not as a fierce torturer but rather as the governor of a model prison, doing his best to make life tolerable for his charges, and helping them to earn remission of sentence.
